                <p>The aim of any good school should be to provide the best possible education to its students. This therefore, is the aim of Delhi Public School. Our primary aim is to develop in the student qualities of integrity, honesty trust tolerance, and compassion; to promote a spirit of enquiry to foster a scientific temper within the bonds of humanism; to help the student to become a meaningful part of his environment and to see that courage and industry have their due reward. The pursuit of excellence encouraged at DPS rests on the positive belief that every man has it in him to produce work, the quality of which can be described as first class.<br>

                    Towards this end the school endeavours to provide a large and dedicated teaching staff with a wide range of skills and interests, a varied and wide choice of activities – academic, aesthetic, and athletic – an environment enriched with the excitement of discovery, challenge and competitiveness and discipline based on the belief that responsibility comes before freedom..</p>
